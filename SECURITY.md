# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This API does not use numeric versioning.  
The service follows a **continuous update model**, ensuring that the production environment is always running with:

- Updated dependencies  
- Immediate application of security patches  
- Continuous enhancements and security improvements  

Therefore, the “current version / latest commit from the main branch” of the API is always the **most up-to-date and secure revision** deployed to production.
